This was the first challenge I joined in, meaning I didn’t have much experience with this kind of deadlines and short time frames, so that was the primary learning goal for it, to test and understand how long each step in the process was, from idea generation to creation to post processing of the render. &
As I had a better understanding of the time frame, the focus shifted and for this it was more focus on displacement using textures and volumetric lighting. The displacement is not extremely visible, but the learning was still there. The cave and the island with the rocks were created using displacement maps, matching the textures used. &
With the two previous being in somewhat fictional settings, I wanted this challenge to be more realistic with the purpose of getting a better understanding of how best to mimic the real world. The biggest takeaway is from the pot and the surface imperfections thereon. At first, I had placed imperfections on the whole pot, with some feedback a better understanding of where to place them to create a more realistic feel was understood &
The Cozy challenge was a particular difficult week for me, as it my time was limited to only 1,5 days of work. That however didn’t stop the learning purposes. Here the focus was on procedural generation of textures and displacement maps. <br/> <br/> The Pancake puffs (Æbleskiver) took most of the time as they were entirely generated through noise and random numbers. Getting the different noise pattern to work together was particularly hard, as that is something I have never worked with before. <br/> <br/> The powdered sugar was also a bit of a challenge, but with the previous understanding of displacement maps (the underground challenge), a displacement map created from snow was used to mimic that of powdered sugar. &

This game was developed as a part of the course Theory and Practice of Game Design and Development. The games were used for the exam of the course. For this project my main role was Programming, but I also was part of designing the levels and creating 3D assets, that were not part of the asset-packets we used. &
Have you ever read a book, and completely disappeared into your own little bubble forgetting everything around you. Last weeks challenge was "Bubble", and for this I decided to try using photo-scanning to add people to scenes, as I haven't gotten around to learning character modelling (yet).<br/><br/>After weeks of trial and error learning Photo-scanning, I found that the primary problem I had was finding a place with proper lighting for the scanning. Although I still haven't found the perfect place, this scan was possible by positioning the subject properly using a window to evenly light her entirely.<br/><br/>This will definitely not be the last time I photo-scan someone, really a fun process. &
"Travelling In a World of White" <br/><br/> I couldn’t think of something whiter than a landscape of clouds. For this one I went further than I normally do, as I did an animation as well as a little sound-design, which was surprisingly fun. <br/><br/>To start with I decided to create each cloud volumetric (many small particles), but that quickly turned out to be a horrible mistake. My computer could not handle so many volumes, so I needed to do some creative problem solving. The solution I ultimately went with was using a 2D picture of clouds as the background animating it to somewhat follow the other clouds. That way the only true clouds where those around the barrel-copter.<br/><br/>Really exciting to take these challenges a couple of steps further, creating a full experience instead of an still image. &

"The definition of Insanity" <br/><br/>This was a completely new style from what I normally would do, with the theme being retro game style. Since I have not played any games pertaining to that era, It started with some research into how they were created and quality in animation and such.<br/><br/>This was again a fun challenge, where I realised how much easier it is to create a full scene , when small details are not there. So next time I have to create a large and complex scene I will try to create it as simple blocks first. I ended up doing some more sound design, which I have found I really enjoy doing. &

"A Surprise Visitor" <br/><br/>With exams taking up most of my time, there wasn't much time to spend, but I still wanted to do something for this week. There is not much to say other than, even though I only spend roughly and hour on it, I still think it turned out way better than some of the challenges I chose not to post. This just shows what experience can do for time spent.  &
