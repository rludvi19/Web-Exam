"The definition of Insanity" <br/>  <br/>This was a completely new style from what I normally would do, with the theme being retro game style. Since I have not played any games pertaining to that era, It started with some research into how they were created and quality in animation and such
<br/><br/>This was again a fun challenge, where I realised how much easier it is to create a full scene , when small details are not there. So next time I have to create a large and complex scene I will try to create it as simple blocks first. I ended up doing some more sound design, which I have found I really enjoy doing. &
